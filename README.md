# Spark_HDInsight_Cluster
## Overview
The goal of this project was to create Spark clusters and provision them with Azure to perform analytics on stock data. 
After provisioning a Spark cluster, Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer is used to add a
Jupyter Notebook to the cluster to perform queries and analytics.

**Steps**
* Deploy an HDInsight Spark cluster
* Work with content stored in Azure Blob Storage and accessed by the Spark cluster
as an HDFS volume
* Use a Jupyter Notebook to interactively explore a large dataset
